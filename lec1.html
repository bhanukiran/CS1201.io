    <quest>Why is everything associated with computers referred to as <u>digital</u>? </quest>
    
    <p>  
      The choice of the word <i>digital</i> in English is historical. But the name owes to the fact that everything that has some representation on a modern computer can be converted into a <u>number</u> - an integer more precisely. <span>Any file: text, image, video, a website, or any new app that you want to install on your phone - everything can be mapped to a number</span>. This is the reason the French use the word <i>numerique</i> instead of digital. <span>What this means is that when you take out your phone and capture a picture, you are essentially capturing a unique integer!</span> And, when you send this across to your friend, you are basically transferring this number. Your friend's device interprets this number and lights up the LEDs on the screen in a way that resembles the picture you have taken. As it happens, for technological reasons, it is easier to design machines that work with these <i>numbers</i> represented in binary system than, say, in decimal or octal system. This is the reason why everything is represented as a stream of binary <i>digits</i> (or <span>bits</span>) in computers - a notion which is quite popular anyway. Not only is everything a number, but <span>everything that you <i>do</i> on a computer is a <u>numerical operation</u></span>. That is, if your friend applies a <i>filter</i> on the image, what she's actually doing is to operate a function on the number and transform it to some other number: very much like how the function <code> f(x) := x^2 </code> maps <code> 2 -> 4</code> and<code> 3 -> 9</code>.
    </p>
    
    <quest>But how can everything be a number? </quest>
    <p>
      To motivate this, we consider the possibility of transmitting a piece of <i>text</i> (in English) by encoding it as binary digits. <span>Imagine you have piece of text message that you'd like to communicate with your friend</span> who is far enough to <i>see</i> you but not close enough to <i>hear</i> you. How can you achieve this?

      We could achieve this by mapping letters in the alphabet to integers the following way:

      By following this scheme the word <b>Harry</b> can be communicated as follows:

    </figure>

    <p>
      By this method, one can convert a text of any length can be converted to a long stream of bits which altogether can be converted to an integer!
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      Instead of coming up with your own encoding, we could use the standard encoding called the <b>ASCII</b> encoding of text which includes not just symbols in English alphabet but all possible punctuation marks and letters that occur in languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. The <b>ASCII</b> encoding also includes encoding of button presses such as BACKSPACE, TAB, ESC etc. Below you can see a preview of the ASCII table taken from <a href="https://www.ascii-code.com/">https://www.ascii-code.com/</a>.

    <quest>How about other forms of information such as media?</quest>
    <p>
      In the class we further discussed the following ideas:
      <ol>
	<li> How binary images (images that re perfectly black and white) can be converted to a stream of bits by considering each pixel as white/black (1 or 0).
	<li> How gray images can be converted to a stream of bits by considering each pixel can have its grayness (an integer value) ranging from 0 to 10 (or some upper limit).
	<li> How colored images can be converted to a stream of bits by considering each pixel as an ordered triple of (R,G,B) values each varying within a range.
	  <span>Go to this website and play around by converting images to binary numbers</span>: <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image"> https://www.dcode.fr/binary-image</a>.
	<li> We have discussed how audio is sampled at a desired rate and how amplitude is discretized and converted to binary.</li>
      </ol>
      An piece of information thus transcribed in the form of 0's and 1's
      <ul>
	<li>       can be communicated as in the above <a href="#text2bin">figure</a>.
	<li>can be processed using mathematical operations

      </ul>
