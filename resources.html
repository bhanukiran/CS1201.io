	<h3>C vs Python?</h3>
	<h4 style="text-align:right"> 24/01/2021 </h4>
	
	<p>
	  To think of different programming languages (<code>C, C++, Python, Java, etc </code>) as mutual rivals is a serious misunderstanding of
	  reality. Fact is that every programming language that you find today would have emerged in a specific historical context and was developed
	  to solve a specific class of computational problems. Therefore, it is rather inappropriate to see any one of them as <b>universally the
	    best</b>. Nonetheless, we can always say that a particular language is the most suitable <i>for a specific kind of tasks</i> - usually the tasks for which
	  it was developed to begin with. For example: <code>C</code> was a language developed in 1970's with the purpose of building an operating system in mind;
	  whereas <code>Java</code> was developed in 1990's - the time that coincides with rapid development of internet - to build applications that
	  run across computers that are connected across a network. So naturally, what <code>C</code> can do easily - <code>C</code> does it easily;
	  and likewise what <code>Java</code> can do it easily - <code>Java</code> does it easily - because its very purpose of existence is
	  associated with it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As it happens <code>Python</code> is a language that was also developed in 1990's, but with a different purpose in mind. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van
	    Rossum</a> (a Dutch programmer) developed Python<a href="#guidoBlog">[1]</a>
	  he wanted to create a quick and easy way of building prototypes. <i>Now, what does that
	    mean?</i> Suppose you have an idea to design a rocket that can enter Jupiter's orbit with very little fuel cost carrying much higher
	  payload.  For people to believe that your idea works, they expect you to come up with a prototype - a miniature version of the real rocket
	  itself.  If the protype fails to stand the tests, there's no way the actual rocket could suceed; on the contrary if the prototype succeeds
	  there are high chances that the actual rocket may succeed. In the same spirit, suppose you conceive a killer mobile application that you
	  think can replace, say <i>WhatsApp</i>, in terms of some specific features etc, you should develop a prototype - real quick - to convice the
	  world that your idea is worth the attention. It is for this purpose that Python generally comes handy. It enables you write programs with
	  non-trivial functionalities in a very short time - <u><i>rapid prototype development</i></u>, as they call it in the business. So naturally
	  if <code>Python</code> feels <i>simple</i>, how is it a surprise? It is supposed to be simple for humans! But eventually when you want to
	  deploy commercial applications that ought to run very fast across devices, you may want to <i>port it</i> to a lower level language such
	  as <i>C/C++</i>. All popular web-browsers such as <b>Firefox</b>, <b>Google Chrome</b> etc and several famous videogames and applications
	  such as <b>Counterstrike</b>, <b>Call of duty</b>, <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> etc are all built using <code>C, C++</code> because 'speed' is a very
	  crucial parameter.  Therefore learning <code>C</code> is still very much relevant for every engineer despite the fact that the language has
	  been around for more than 50 years.</p>
	<p>
	  In recent years, thanks to faster CPUs and
	  cheaper avialbility of RAMs, <code>Python</code> has emerged as a favourite
	  to many academicians as well as industry programmers because it
	  provides a quick way of solving a broad class problems -
	  ranging from scientific computing to web-development - without having to write long tedious programs in lower level languages. It has
	  come to be particularly well known among developers and
	  researchers of Machine learning which makes it a very
	  important language to master. But, one should also keep in
	  mind that most of the heavy duty tools that work in the
	  background of machine learning programs are written in speed
	  efficient languages such as <code>C, C++</code>. As a matter
	  of fact, the language <code>Python</code> (the Python
	  interpretor, that is the engine that makes Python work)
	  itself is written in <code>C</code>!  Imagine how silly one
	  sounds to argue that <i>bread</i> is a rival
	  to <i>flour</i>! Can bread ever compete to be better than
	  the flour? The question itself makes little sense!
	</p>
	
	<h4>Conclusion</h4> 
	<p>
	  Python is a high level language (higher because it is closer to human logic than to machine logic) used to solve specific kinds of problems
	  by developing quick solutions. C, on the other hand is a lower language and has been used in developing some very important applicaitons
	  that will continue to be important in forseeable future. Therefore, as beginners, rather than seeing them as rivals one trying to dethrone
	  the other, we see them as two different tools (both very important) each suited for specific tasks. It is all about choosing the right tool
	  for the right job.
