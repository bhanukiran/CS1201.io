      We know how often we use variables in science and mathematics. In computer science also you see variable being used in almost all the programs. However, in computer programming, rather than being abstract symbols, variables are like <b>small boxes</b> (located in the RAM) in which binary data is stored. Every variable that we use in a program has a unique <i>physical</i> location in the RAM of the computer. The <i>amount</i> and the <i>kind</i> of data that a given variable can accommodate depends on the <i>type</i> of the variable. Each variable is uniquely identified by a name and a type at the time of its creation (variable declaration). So long as the variable is <i>alive</i>, the box with a label is kept avialable in the RAM.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="C">
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	int main(){
	    int n = 32;
	    float x = 3.1;
	}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
    In the above C code, two different variables have been declared:
    <ul>
      <li> <code>n</code> as an <code>int</code> and has been assigned a value 32.</li>
      <li> and, <code>x</code> as a <code>float</code> and has been assigned assigned a value 3.1.
    </ul>

    The symbole <code>=</code> has an entirely different meaning in computer science as compared with its usage in mathematics. In mathematics when we see a statement such as <code>x = 2</code> it essentially means that the value of <code>x</code> being equal to 2 is a <i>fact</i> and it remains true in the rest of the argument. However in computer science, the symbol <code>=</code> is what is called an assignment operator that has a certain action associated to it. It basically the value to its right-hand-side and <i>assigns</i> it to the symbol on its left-hand-side. A variable that is declared but not assigned any value may assume a some arbitrary value. That's because, by declaring the variable, you created a box in the RAM in place that may have been used by some other application so the value it assumes could be random.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this point of code, the names <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> refer to two <i>boxes</i> both containing 32 bits. But, since we know that <code>n</code> is an <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is a <code>float</code>, the boxes will be interpreted differently.

      <ol>
	<li> A variable name may only consist of letters, digits and the underscore (_) characters.
	<li> A variable name must begin with a letter. But <u>never</u> with a numeral digit.
	<li> Although, there may not be a strict upper limit on the length of the variable name, it if better keep it short and sensible.
	<li> Uppercase and lowercase are significant. That is the variable Totamt is not the same as numCandies and NumCandies.
	<li> The variable name may not be a C reserved word (<a href="#Cvocab">Look: C Keywords</a>).
      </ol>
      And, also, 
    </p>

    
    <quest>A variable thus born, what is its lifetime?</quest>
    <p>
      A variable that is initialized as shown above stays <i>alive</i> only within its <i>scope</i>. Where <u>scope</u> is the region within the closest pair of braces that enclose the variable. For instance in the following program the life of <code>n</code> is confined within lines:4-6. Beyond that you cannot access it.
    </p>
<pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    { //start
	int n = 32;
    } //end
    float x = 3.1;
    }</code></pre>

    <p>
      A variable name cannot be reused within a scope:
    </p>
<pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    int x = 432;
    float x = 3.1; //this leads to an error due to redefinition of ‘x’
    }</code></pre>    

    <quest> Suppose I created a variable <code>int x = 32;</code> and I want to convert it to a float, can I do that?</quest>
    <p>
      You cannot change the type of a variable within its scope, but you can access its value and <i>cast</i> the value into a compatible format. <u>Compatibility</u> is a key issue here. A <code>32-bit-int</code> can be cast to a <code>32-bit-float</code> easily, but casting a <code>float</code> to an <code>int</code> takes only the integer value - this is called truncation. Therefore the compatibility is not necessarily symmetric. Similarly, a <code>32-bit-int</code> can be cast to a <code>32-bit-long</code> and the other way is not possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to convert a value &lt;val&gt; of any type to a value of &lt;different_type&gt; we use the following command:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <code> (&lt;different_type&gt;)&lt;val&gt;</code>
    </p>

<pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    float x = 12.34;;
    double y = -21.213;
    int n = 32;
    double huge_x = 5678.3213;
    }</code></pre>        


    <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
      <table id="Cvocab" width="100%">
	<caption>Vocabulary of C programming language (alphabetic order)</caption>
	<tr>
	  <th>Type casting command</th>
	  <th>The new value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><code>(int)x</code></td>
	  <td> the truncated integer 12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><code>(double)x</code></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>

	  <td>-21</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><code>(char)huge_x</code></td>
	  <td> some unexpected value because the number is too huge for a char</td>
	</tr>

    <quest>How to input and output variable values?</quest>
    <p>
      Not all computers have monitors! And not all programs 'print' stuff on screens. Imagine the router that you are probably connect to right now - there is computation going on in it, but it doesn't print anything anywhere does it? The <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt</code> directive that we often at the top of our C programs essentially gives the program the ability to interact with the use by taking inputs and giving outputs from the screen.

<!--       If  -->
<!--     </p> -->
<!--     <p> -->
<!--       To print the values of <code>int</code>s and <code>float</code>s, we use the 'placeholders' <code>%d</code> and <code>%f</code> as shown in the example below. -->
<!--     </p> -->

<!-- <pre class="C"><code> -->
<!-- #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; -->
<!-- int main(){ -->
<!--   int pages = 250; //no. pages in a book -->
<!--   float price = 100.5; //price of the book -->

<!--   printf("The book has %d pages, and it costs %f rupees\n" , pages, price); -->
<!--   return 0;  -->
<!-- }</code></pre>             -->
