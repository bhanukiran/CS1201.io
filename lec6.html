    The <i>amount</i> and the <i>kind</i> of data that a given variable can accommodate depends on the <i>type</i> of the variable. As it turns out we use variables all the time to perform computations just like how we use variables in mathematics and physics. Each variable is uniquely identified by a name and a type at the time of its creation (variable declaration). A typical declaration statement looks like this:
