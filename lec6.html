    The <i>amount</i> and the <i>kind</i> of data that a given variable can accommodate depends on the <i>type</i> of the variable. As it turns out we use variables all the time to perform computations just like how we use variables in mathematics and physics. To distinguish among different variables, each variable is given a unique name at the time of creation. The step during which a variable is named and its type is declared is called variable declaration. A typical declaration statement looks like this:
