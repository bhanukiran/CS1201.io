    <h4 id="lec4">[Lecture 3] Computational problems</h4>

    <quest>What are computational problems?</quest><br>
    
    We are all familiar with the notion of a 'problem' in general usage of the word. Here are examples of some problems:
    <div class="container" class="center">
      <ol>
	<li> What is the meaning of life?
	<li> What is truth? What is perception?
	<li style="font-weight:600"> How many of your Facebook friends are younger than you?
	<li style="font-weight:600"> What is the cheapest air ticket to Tokyo this week?
	<li> Does the tatoo look good on me?
	<li style="font-weight:600"> Given a positive integer n, what is the nth prime number?
	<li style="font-weight:600"> What is the average rainfall in south India in last 10 years?
	<li> What will be the temperature in Hyderabad on 21 May 2032?
	<li> Does my dog love me?
	<li style="font-weight:600"> Does the polynomial <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2 x^{16} - 3 x^{11} + x^4 - 109 = 0"/>
	  have an integer solution?
      </ol>
    </div>    
    <p>
      The questions that are highlighted in the above list have something in common: they can all be solved by writing computer programs; and it is not the case with the others. Problems that can be solved by writing computer programs are called <i>computational problems</i>. More precisely, <span>a problem qualifies as a computational problem</span> when it satisfies the following properties:
      <ol>
	<li> <b>The problem statement should be absolutely unambiguous.</b>
	  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
	    <li>Questions such as <i>Does my dog love me?</i> and <i>What is the meaning of life?</i> do not qualify because they are ambiguous<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.
	  </ul>
	<li> <b>The problem should have a <u>well defined</u> and <u>finite</u> input.</b>
	  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
	    <li> Questions such as <i>What will be the temperature in Hyderabad next year today?</i> may probably be answered if you know every minute detail about atmosphere of the entire planet, the factors that influence it, and the laws that govern them. But it is practically impossible to handle such huge amounts of data and to ensure the answer is correct.
	  </ul>
	<li> <b>The problem should expect a <u>well defined</u> and <u>finite</u> output.</b>
	  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
	    <li> If the answer to a question is not understandable, or if it is too huge to process in one life time, such questions are deemed to be useless and we don't adddress them.
	  </ul>
	<li> <b>The problem should be solvable by running a program on a realistic computer.</b>
	  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
	    <li>Since computers are physical devices, they should always obey the laws of physics and only possess realistic abilities. For instance, we cannot assume the existence of computers that can travel back in time. Eg:<i>How many times did it rain during the bronze age exactly?</i>
	  </ul>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p id="footnote-1">[1]
      The terms such as <i>love</i> and <i>meaning</i> are too vague for a machine.
    </p>

    <quest>Input and output?</quest><br>

    Rubik's cude -> 

    Sudoku -> 

    Image -> filter, effects

    Matrix -> determinant 

    intuitive idea of method -> expressed clearly as an algorithm (often as a flowchart) -> instructions in a high level language -> arithmetic operations in machine level.
