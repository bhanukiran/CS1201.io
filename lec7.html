    <h3 id="lec7">[Lecture 7] Conditionals - incorportating logic into programs </h3>

    <quest>Why do we need logic in programs?</quest>    
    <p>
      Suppose you want to build a self driving car. The car needs to be <i>smart</i> enough to find its way through the traffic and the terrain, and reach its destination without causing any troubles or violating traffic rules. Such a task requires ability to make logical decisions. The following are examples of such decisions:
      <ol>
	<li> When to accelerate?</li>
	<li> Which gear to use?</li>
	<li> When to slow down?</li>
	<li> When to apply the brake, and how much? etc</li>
      </ol>
      Such questions can be answered by performing computations on various quantities such as <i>the current speed</i>, <i>distance and state of various obstacles</i>, <i>color of the traffic lights</i> etc. When we drive a car ourselves, our brains are capable of performing these computations involuntarily, and we decide our actions based on that. However, while designing a self driving car it requires that we explicitly incorporate such decision taking (logical) abilities into the software for the car. Here's a simple example - suppose a car is approaching a traffic signal. It has to do different things in different circumstances:
    </p>

    <div class="center" style="text-align: left;">
    <b>If</b> (the signal light glows <font color="red">red</font>)<br>
    <p class="tab1">it has to <b><u>stop</u></b>;</p>
    <b>else if</b> (it glows <font color="orange">orange</font>)
    <p class="tab1">go slow with <u><b>caution</b></u>;</p>
    <b>else if</b> (it glow <font color="green">green</font>)
    <p class="tab1"><u><b>proceed;</b></u></p>
    <b>else</b> 
    <p class="tab1"><u><b>Report Malfunction!</b></u></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      To be able to do something like this, the car should have the following capabilities
      <ol>
	<li> Detect the color of the traffic signal</li>
	<li> Compare the detected color with <font color="red">red</font>, <font color="orange">orange</font> and <font color="green">green</font> and do what is appropriate in each case. 
      </ol>
      Such kind of <i>smartness</i>, ie. ability to make logical decisions, can be incorporated into computer programs by using the <i>conditional statements</i>. Conditional statements are basic constructs that are present in almost all programming langauges. In fact,

    <quest>Logic is all about controlling the flow of decisions!</quest>
<p>
    Consider the following piece of code in which there are some computational operations lined up as <code>action 1;</code>, <code>action 2;</code>, etc.

    <pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){

    action 1; 

    action 2;

}</code></pre>       
   
    In this example program, <code>action 1;</code>, <code>action 2;</code> etc will be executed one after the other. That's equivalent to a self-driving car performing: <i>the brake, the accelerator, the a hand signal</i> one after another without caring for any context! We can make it such that <code>action 1;</code> is performed under certain circumstances whereas <code>action 2;</code> are performed in other circumstances.
</p>

<h4>The <code>if</code> construct: </h4>  
<p>
<pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){

    if (condition 1) {
        action 1;
    }

    action 2;

}</code></pre>
In stead of perfoming all the actions in a serial manner the if construct performs <code>action 1;</code> only when <code>codition 1</code> is true; and <code>action 2;</code> is performed in either case.
</p>. 

<h4>The <code>if - else</code> construct: </h4>  
<p>
<pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    if (condition 1) {
        action 1;
    }
    else{
        action 2;
    }
}</code></pre>

<code>action 1;</code> is performed when <code>codition 1</code> holds true; and <code>action 2;</code> is performed  <code>codition 1</code> is false.
</p>


<h4>The <code>if - else if - else</code> construct: </h4>  
<p>
<pre class="C"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    if (condition 1) {
        action 1;
    }
    else if(condition 2){
        action 2;
    }
    else{
        action 3;
    }
}</code></pre>

<ol>
  <li> <code>action 1;</code> is performed when <code>codition 1</code> is true.
  <li> <code>action 2;</code> is performed  <code>codition 1</code> is false but <code>codition 2</code> is true.
  <li> <code>action 3;</code> is performed when neither condition is true.
</ol>
</p>

    <p> In the above example, <code>condition 1;</code> and <code>condition 2;</code> are what are called <i>boolean expressions</i> [Look here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_expression</a>].
    </p>


    <h4>Nested conditionals</h4>

    Suppose the car is move as speed S kmph and the road has a <b>speed limit of 80 kmph</b>. You want to take a decision whether to speed up the car based on certain contions. For example:
    <ul>
      <li> If the car is going too fast (&lt; 80 Kmph): slow down
      <li> Else If the car is going too slow (&gt; 70 Kmph): speed up to 75.
      <li> otherwise, proceed at the same speed.
    </ul>

</figure>	

We can translate this logic to a <code>C</code> program as follows:
<pre class="C"><code>

    if (speed >= 80) {
        slow down!;
    }
    else{
         if(speed &lt; 70){
            speed up to 75;
        }
        else{
            don not change;
        }
    }		    
</code></pre>
In this example, there is an inner <code>if-else</code> statement within the outer <code>if-else</code> statement - such statements are called nested conditionals. In fact, there can be another <code>if-else</code> statement within the inner <code>if-else</code> and so on.
