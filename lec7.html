    Imagine you are programming a selfdriving car. The car has to take a sequence of decisions as it finds its way to the destination. Ideally, we want these decisions to be absolutely logical lest the car gets caught in an accident or traffic violation. For example: <b>If</b> the signal light glows <u>red</u>, it has to <u>stop</u> at a signal; <b>else if</b> it glows <u>orange</u>, we want it to proceed with <u>caution</u>, <b>else if</b> it is green we <u>proceed</u> without any worries. 

    Suppose, the decision of when to apply a brake will be logical only when you take various parameters into account. These parameters may include speed, distance from the obstacle, traffic, size of the vehicale etc - into account. If you mindlessly hit the break, that may lead some serious disaster and you'll end cursing yourself you have acted mindlessly! A <i>decision</i> is said to be <u>logical</u> when it is taken subject to certain conditons. 

    If you have ever seen an automatic scooter (such as Scooty, Acitva, etc) and even wonder who they go so smooth without having
