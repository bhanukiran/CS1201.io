    <p>
      As you can see in the above videos, different laws of physics are exploited to store memory in different physical devices.
      <ul>
	<li> To read and write from an HDD: Magnetic field is used to manipulate the tiny magnetic grains.
	<li> Lasers are used to read and write from CDs and DVDs.
      </ul>
    </p>
    Naturally, the deeper the laws of physics we want to use, the more sophisticated the engineering will look be.

    For instance, the solids-state hard disks that have come recently into the consumer market use much more complicated physics. Checkout the following video:<br>

    <!-- Q2 --> <quest>Why does my computer have two different memories namely RAM & ROM?</quest><br>

    <p>
      <b>Convenient Answer:</b> Consider the example that we discussed in the previous lecture - where binary data is communicated between two persons via hand gestures. One can understand that a human receiver cannot possibly remember a billion symbols all at once and process it all at one go. It may be his limitation that he could remember only 10 symbols at once and not more than that. In this case, he'll maintain a record of all the bits that he received by storing them in some physical form. The temporary memory that is stored in his head as he process the ten bits may understood as RAM; and the books in which he records this data may be understood as a ROM.

    <p>
      <b>Actual answer:</b> The truth is that the distinction  between RAM and ROM is an artificial one and exists solely because we don't have a single storage medium that is both fast and vast as well as non-volatile. What we know today as "von Neumann architecture" -- the dominant computer architecture for over 50 years -- is a direct result of this deficiency[<a href="#codebook">Ref 1</a>]. 
      Nevertheless, for all practical purposes one can visualize RAM as a memory that stays close to the CPU and enables a quick place to read from and write to; where as a ROM is where data is stored permanently such that it is available even after the power plug is pulled off. A program file, say firefox.exe in a windows computer, exists on the ROM and when you click on it to execute it.. it gets copied to RAM and runs as it is intended to. In computer programming whenever we use the word <i>memory</i> we almost always mean RAM.

    Finally, watch this video for an excellent overview of van Neumann architecture of modern computers, we'll discuss more about this in the lectures that follow.
